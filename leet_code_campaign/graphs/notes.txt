    Root node: The root nodeis the ancestor of all other nodes in a Graph
    it does not have any ancestor

    Leaf Nodes: Nodes that dn't have children

    Undirected graph, all edges are bidirectional

    Directed graph: a graph which all the edges are 
    uni-directional the edges point in a single directional

    Weighted graph: each edge is assigned a weight or cost
