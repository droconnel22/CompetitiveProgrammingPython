461. Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between twoo integers is the number 
of positions at which the corresponding bits are
different.

Given two integers x and y calcuate the Hamming
distance.

Note:
0 < x, y < 2^31

Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
