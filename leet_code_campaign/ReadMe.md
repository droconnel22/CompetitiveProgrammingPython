1. explain the logic
2. code the logic

Will contain the problem link on leet code !!
and the problem code on github

What to do if you don't understand an explanation or code video (Important)
If you have any problems with any explanation video, feel free to reach me on the Q & A section of the course and I will  answer with the problem's explanation, generally, if I see a question on Q & A my general procedure is to :

1- answer the question / explain what you want
2- check out the video to see if I can do better, actually so far I've re-recorded more than 10 lectures from scratch because I thought that I code do them better, did some edits on about 3, so I'm always improving the course

Utilize the video format of online courses
Don't forget, you just absolutely maximize your advantage of watching a course online by utilizing the pause button, lower/fasten the speed of the course, roll back to complicated parts to cement the knowledge, etc

Use these advantages to maximize your learning experience, it's worth it
