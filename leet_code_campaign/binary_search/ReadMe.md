A search technique to find 
elements in a collection

first thought for search

but only works on sorted collectioins

Say we want to find the element 13
initial might be to just walk 
over the warray and search foor it

in a linear search

1. Initialize 2 pointers
- start at the beginning of the array
- end at the end of array
2. Find the element at the middle of 2 elements
3. if element at the middle is bigger than our goal, set end pointer to middle.
4. if the element at the middle is smaller than our goal we set the start to the middle+1
